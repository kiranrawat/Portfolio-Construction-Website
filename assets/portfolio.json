    "intro": "In today's innovative culture, data is a massive part in deciding the company's future. I am a Data Scientist with more than one year of experience performing data-driven solutions to increase effectiveness, accuracy, and service of internal data processing.<br><br> I have completed my Masters in Computing Science (Big Data) at Simon Fraser University. I did my Data Science co-op from SSR Mining, where I practically got to apply my academia knowledge in a mining world to generate machine learning and data-driven solutions at a massive scale.<br><br>My peers describe me as a confident person with excellent presentation skills. I have a knack for solving puzzles and understanding complex problems. I like to have a positive outlook on my work and strive for perfection in my daily tasks.<br><br>I have graduated in June 2020 and looking for opportunities in Data Science and Data Engineering domain. I want to utilize my skills as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist to create a progressive environment.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me. I would love to hear from you. My contact details can be found out on this website.",
